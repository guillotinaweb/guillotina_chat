guillotina_chat Docs
====================

This is a simple package that is designed to be used as reference material
for the `Guillotina training section of the docs
<http://guillotina.readthedocs.io/en/latest/training/index.html>`_.

It's really not meant for anything other than training so don't expect this
to be useful!
